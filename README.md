In response to the rampant, injurious emergence of misinformation during the pandemic, our group felt compelled to create InfoCheck; InfoCheck is an innovative, novel technology capable of diagnosing the validity and credibility of a user’s inputted web platform. InfoCheck was created with a variety of technologies and softwares including but not limited to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our group has personally previously witnessed the countless unreliable and misinformed sources while doing research for external projects and with InfoCheck, we’re able to diagnose and respond to these unreliable sources. InfoCheck is able to accurately specific sources, and also takes into consideration external factors beyond solely the domain of the specific sources -- for example, cnn.com or foxnews.com would both be trustworthy sources due to their domains; however, given their partisan nature, InfoCheck suggests that these platforms can be misleading and untrustworthy. In regard to the experience of our team, for many of us, this was the first hackathon we’ve participated in, doing so with minimal past background knowledge about computer science; through this hackathon, though, we’ve further developed our skills with computer science. We’re proud to have created InfoCheck through this hackathon, and look forward to further developing it to encourage the formation of a stronger, healthier, and more well-informed community for generations to come.
